This is the experiments repo for the MIDAS project.

The organization of the folders used is:
Level 1: Use Case/Algorithm Name
Level 2: Pilot Type:
	Vanilla: Folder named Vanilla has the data of exepriments run with RADICAL-Pilot
	Spark: Folder named Spark has the data of exepriments run with Pilot-Spark
	Yarn: Folder named Yarn has the data of exepriments run with Pilot-Yarn

For level 3 folders the organization is in the discretion of each user. A README file should exist connecting the exepriment setup with the associated csv file.

There may be a Jupyter Notebook in some folders. please use that to make plots and always commit the changes for others to be able to use.

Finally, graphs should be under Level 1 folders for quick access, the README file can have a small description of the graph along with its file name.
