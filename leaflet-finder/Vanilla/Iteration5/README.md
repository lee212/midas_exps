These expariments of leaflet finder were executed on Comet. The implementation resembles the execution pattern of the leaflet finder spark script.

The file name provides the following information:
  1. Algorith
  2. Run #
  3. Number of Cores
    - For Comet, due to RP's limitation we used 4 times the number of cores of those that were actually needed. Each CU was assigned 4 cores and used only 1.
